This is a standard maven project so please use the according import option in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

# Done

## GraphToolList

- `BreadthFirstSearch` with its execution time
- `DepthFirstSearch` with its execution time
- `Dijkra` algorithm with its complexity

## BinaryHeap & BinaryHeapEdge

- `BinaryHeap` completed
- `BinaryHeapEdge` completed

# Not done

- `Bellman` algorithm
- `computeInverse`

# Launch tests

- To test `BreadthFirstSearch`, `DepthFirstSearch`, `Dijkra` simply execute the main of `GraphToolList`
 (To unroll the `BreadthFirstSearch` and `DepthFirstSearch` algorithms step by step set the `_DEBBUG` value to 1)

- To test `BinaryHeap` and `BinaryHeapEdge` execute the main of both files
